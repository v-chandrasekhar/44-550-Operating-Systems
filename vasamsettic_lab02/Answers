* Run your program a few times.  What do you notice about the PIDs that are output?
  In each run PIDs are different.


* What do you notice about the number that is output to the screen?  What does this tell you about the memory for processes?
  Is it shared? separate? something completely different?
  The parent process pid and the child process pid numbers are in the sequence. The parent process and the child process PIDs are
  different. The memory is shared between the processes the global variable value is same for both processes.


* You may notice that, even if you srand() with time(NULL), both processes are adding the same value to the global integer.
How could you make it so the random number generators aren't synced up? (remember that time(NULL)) only has second resolution.
What else could you pass to srand that will be unique to each Process.  Some kind of IDentifying number, perhaps...

   Different seed will get you a different value
